# Instructions
The program should be launched from a command prompt terminal with few argument switches.

Action switches:
<br>``-x`` Extracts text data from a ztr file into a text file
<br>``-c`` Decompressed conversion. this converts the text data from the extracted text file to the ztr format in a decompressed format.
<br>``-c2`` Compressed conversion (slower). this convert the text data from the extracted text file to the ztr format in a compressed format.
<br>``-h`` or ``-?`` Displays the tool's usage instructions.

GameCode switches:
<br>``-ff131`` Use this switch when working with 'FINAL FANATAST XIII' ztr files.
<br>``-ff132`` Use this switch when working with 'FINAL FANATAST XIII-2' ztr files. 
<br>``-ff133`` Use this switch when working with 'LIGHTNING RETURNS FINAL FANATAST XIII' ztr files 

<br>Encoding switches
<br>``-auto`` Automaticall determine the encoding to use depending on the ztr/ text filename 
<br>``-ch`` Chinese encoding. use this for chinese language ztr files. ex: txtres_ch.ztr file.
<br>``-kr`` Korean encoding. use this for korean language ztr files. ex: txtres_kr.ztr file.
<br>``-lj`` Latin/ Japanese encoding. use this for english, french, german, italian, japanese and spanish ztr files."

<br>Commandline usage examples:
<br>``ZTRtool.exe -x -ff131 -auto "txtres_us.ztr" ``
<br>``ZTRtool.exe -c -ff131 -auto "txtres_us.ztr" ``
<br>``ZTRtool.exe -c2 -ff131 -auto "txtres_us.ztr" ``

## Important Notes
- Use the appropriate game code and encoding switches when using this tool. this is very important and using a wrong switch can result in incorrect extraction or conversion of the text data.
- Use the ``-lj`` encoding switch when dealing with ZTR files that use latin alphabets and japanese characters.
- The ``-c2`` action switch is recommended only for ZTR files that need to be in a 'compressed' state. for instance the ZTR files packed inside the .bin files that being with the name `auto_`, located in the folder ``weiss_data\db\ai\npc\pack`` in LIGHTNING RETURNS FINAL FANTASY, all require the ZTR files to be in a compressed format.
- The extracted text file would contain special keys along with the text data. a comprehensive list of valid keys can be found in this page linked below:
<br>https://github.com/LR-Research-Team/Datalog/wiki/Encoding-Keys-Info

- Special latin characters like ``Ã€`` would also have to be put inside a `{ }` just like the encoding keys.
- ZTR files that are named ``txtres_ck.ztr`` are all unused by the games and this tool will not extract or convert them properly.
- For developers only. put the `-debug` switch after the ztr filename for dumping raw data of the files during the various extraction/conversion stages.
<br>The following example mentioned below, would launch the tool in a debug state:
<br>``ZTRtool.exe -x -ff131 -auto "txtres_us.ztr" -debug``
